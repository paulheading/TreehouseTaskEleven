# Treehouse Task Eleven

For this project, I used the popular Express web application framework and a SQL database to create a REST API that lets users create, read, update, and delete items from a school database.

## Instructions

Open the folder locally in terminal and type `npm install`. Then seed the database by typing `npm run seed`. To test the Express server, type `npm start` and visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.
